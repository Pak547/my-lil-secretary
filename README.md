## Description

A simple workday scheduler listing 9-5 time blocks to be able to organize your ToDos and see the current, past, and future times.

Implementing dayjs this project prepares me for clients who need a to incorporate the current time and want to be able to save details.

This solves the problem of a messy unorganized workday.

I learned how to use conditionals when comparing time (object) with strings or integers.

## Usage
The colors meaning:
red = present
grey = past
green = future

You can insert text and save the value into storage

Once you have pressed the save button, check local storage to see the value! Upon page reload it should still be saved unless deleted
